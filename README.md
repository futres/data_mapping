# data mapping of legacy data to the template

This is to be done before the pipeline.

Data mapping files use data imported into the <a href="de.cyverse.org">Discovery Environment</a> from <a href="https://geome-db.org/workbench/template"> GEOME</a>. 

We work with the data contributer to make sure the terms map correctly to the terms already in the <a href="http://obofoundry.org/ontology/fovt">FOVT</a>. Data mapping and clean up are doing using Jupyter notebook.

To request terms, please see the <a href="github.com/futres/fovt">FOVT GitHub</a> and submit an issue.
