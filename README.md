# data mapping of legacy data to the template

For some users we've written custom scripts, but we prefer if users input data using the template in <a href="https://geome-db.org/workbench/template"> GEOME</a>.

We work with the data contributer to make sure the terms map correctly to the terms already in the <a href="http://obofoundry.org/ontology/fovt">FOVT</a>. Data mapping and clean up are doing using Jupyter notebook in /scripts.

1. Data mapping files use data imported into the <a href="de.cyverse.org">Discovery Environment</a>.
2. Mapped files are then validated in <a href="https://geome-db.org/workbench/template"> GEOME</a>. 
3. Mapped files are then returned to the Discovery Environment.

To request terms, please see the <a href="github.com/futres/fovt">FOVT GitHub</a> and submit an issue.
